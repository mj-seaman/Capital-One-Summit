This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Prompt
Build a web application that has a search function displaying results in an interface. Gives users the ability to search results by date aired, trivia category, level of difficulty of the question.

# My experience
This was my first time using React, JavaScript, CSS, and S3. In college I have been taught about how the different languages work, but this is the first time I have been able to apply knowledge into making a usable product. I am thankful that I was able to try this challenge because I learned many new skills that will help me in the future. 

In React I learned how to make buttons that have actions when they are clicked by the user, including showing data from an API. I learned how to create search dropdowns that search through API data in order to find the users input. I also learned a lot of new skills in CSS; I wish I had more time to develop the design of my web application. In S3 I learned how to make a web application and change the hosting, privacy, and settings.

# My Solution
 In my web application, I have multiple search dropdowns for the user to enter what they would like to search for.  The search dropdowns get information from the API and gives the user suggestions based on what they are typing. I was unable to then show the user the trivia questions related to their search, however. That would be my next step in creating a better web application.

The application then has a button that shows the user all of the trivia in http://jservice.io/api/clues when pressed. It does this by getting the desired elements from the API and displaying them to the user in an understandable way.

I also created a button that allows the user to get random trivia from the API. I did this by calling http://jservice.io/api/random and getting a new random clue every time the button is pressed.

My live deployed website is located at http://www.maryjeanine-seaman.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
I hosted my website with S3 in AWS because I consulted some people currently working the tech industry and they recommended knowing AWS. I have previously made a website with AWS, but it is very helpful to know how to host a web application.

# Next Steps
I was not able to excess the API correctly, so I my web application finds matches in the trivia from http://jservice.io/api/clues. My next step would be to collaborate with people who understand the API better so my web app can search through all of the trivia questions. 

My search dropdowns find the elements that start with what the user inputs. I would like to change this to be able to find what the user types anywhere within the elements in the API. 

Another step that I would take is creating a save option where the user could save any trivia that they liked and could visit again later.
