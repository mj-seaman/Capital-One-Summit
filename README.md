# My experience
This was my first time using React, Javascript, CSS, and Heroku. In college I have been taught about how the different languages work, but this is the first time I have been able to apply knowledge into making a usable product. I am thankful that I was able to try this challenge because I learned many new skills that will help me in the future. 

On React I learned how to make buttons that show a something from an API when clicked and search dropdowns that search through API data in order to find the users input. I also learned a lot of new skills on CSS, but did not have enough time to design everything the way I would have liked to.
