This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Prompt
Build a web application that has a search function displaying results in an interface. Gives users the ability to search results by date aired, trivia category, level of difficulty of the question.

# My experience
This was my first time using React, Javascript, CSS, and Heroku. In college I have been taught about how the different languages work, but this is the first time I have been able to apply knowledge into making a usable product. I am thankful that I was able to try this challenge because I learned many new skills that will help me in the future. 

On React I learned how to make buttons that show a something from an API when clicked and search dropdowns that search through API data in order to find the users input. I also learned a lot of new skills on CSS, but did not have a lot time to design everything the way I would have liked to. 

# My Solution
I created multiple search dropdowns in order to let the user know which elements from each category they can choose from, and searched through the API in order to find matches in the selected categories.

I made a button, that when pressed shows the user all of the trivia in http://jservice.io/api/clues.

I also created a button that allows the user to get random trivia from the API.

# Next Steps
I was not able to excess the API correctly, so I my search finds matches in the trivia from http://jservice.io/api/clues. My next step would be to search through all of the trivia quesitons. 

My search dropdowns find the elements that start with what the user inputs. I would like to change this to be able to find what the user types anywhere within the elements. 

Another step that I would take is creating a save option where the user could save any trivia that they liked and could visit again later.
